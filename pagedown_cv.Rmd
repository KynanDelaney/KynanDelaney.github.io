### Biologist & Data Scientist

I am an ecologist recently graduated from a PhD at the University of Edinburgh.

My research interests have been focused on how ageing manifests in demographic and phenotypic traits and across shifts in environment. Through my work, I have gained quantitative skills in diverse forms of analysis, from time series and survival analyses, to computer-vision and GIS methods. My worked involved primary data collection, as well as the analysis of existing datasets, all involving messy, real-world biological data.
